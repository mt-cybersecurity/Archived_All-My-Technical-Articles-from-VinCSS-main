The Heaven's Gate technique allows 32-bit applications running on 64-bit Windows systems to execute 64-bit code. This is achieved by manipulating the Windows-on-Windows 64-bit (WOW64) subsystem, which enables 32-bit applications to run in a 64-bit environment. By doing so, malware can bypass security measures that monitor 32-bit processes, effectively hiding its activities from antivirus software.
